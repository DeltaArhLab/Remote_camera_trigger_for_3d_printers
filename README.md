# Remote_camera_trigger_for_3d_printers
Remote camera (DSLR / mirrorless) trigger for 3d printers. This project is made with intention of making 3d printing time lapse videos with DSLR camera. We are using Arduino as a controller, magnets and cheap hall effect sensor to trigger the IR diode which triggers the camera. Custom PrusaSlicer commands position the toolhead at the same position every time so the time lapse are nice and clean.
